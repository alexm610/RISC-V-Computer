NEW MISSION STATEMENT: Create a RISC-V compatible computer on the FPGA
	makes more sense to make it on FPGA first before trying to make physical computer, since I have no experience with that.

1) Start with ALU
	- move ALU files from simple RISC machine to this repo
	- isolate major ALU type operations listed in the base instruction set for RISC-V and implement in ALU
	- don't forget your test benches!












try writing a report!
	with project updates (including dates of modifications and whatnot)
	make very detailed notes along the way of this project
	when completed, write a report
