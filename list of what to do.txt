NEW MISSION STATEMENT: Create a RISC-V compatible computer on the FPGA
	makes more sense to make it on FPGA first before trying to make physical computer, since I have no experience with that.

Start with ALU

try writing a report!
	with project updates (including dates of modifications and whatnot)
	make very detailed notes along the way of this project
	when completed, write a report
