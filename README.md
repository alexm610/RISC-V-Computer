# RISC-V Computer

This project is an implementation of a RISC-V based processor on an FPGA. It is a work in progress.
The processor will be of my own design, and will be run on a DE1-SoC. The end goal will to have all instructions in the RV32I instruction set implemented in the processor, such that a standard RISC-V compiler may be used to compile code that can be directly run on this custom processor. 

To begin, only seven instructions will be implemented; []. These instructions are (probably) the minimum instructions required for the processor to be considered Turing-Complete.
